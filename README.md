WIMP - Work in maintained progress

Current functionality:

Version -
2.01 - Functionality is according to a normal 3D scientific graphing calculator

Future functionality:

Version -
2.02 - Integration of multiple plots in the same graph
2.03 - Integration of further parsing of all symbols inherent in the sympy library
2.04 - Integration of all symbols not inherent in the sympy library such as notations used in quantum physics though manual definition of rules

2.05 - Integration of time dependence
2.06 - Integration of aestethic & ease of use fedality and  refinement regarding the UI
2.07 - Integration of further functionality regarding the merging and coherence of plot behaviour
2.09 - Integration of graph classes which include mutliple plots which cohere or are intependent 
2.09 - Integraton of a rendering process, saving the frames generated (2.05), then converting them to mp4 or other video formats


3.00 - Integration of an advanced rendering process, saving all the 3D data from the according plots or a graph/graphs containing fused plots. Into readable formats i.e. Blender and other 3D software
3.01 - Integration of an advanced rendering process, saving all the 3D data as well as their position changing in position across frames/time (2.05) from the according plots and or a graph/graphs containing fused plots. Into readable formats i.e. Blender and other 3D software
3.02 - Final Beta release after further tweaking of UI and aestheticism
Description

This is an unfinished project I am working on, in the finished software I want to be able to define 3D structures through simple or complex mathematical descriptions. Additionally I'm going to integrate time variables and rates of change for the individual functions through this 4th dimension in independent frame progressions, to allow animation.
